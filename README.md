pycodegolf
==========

A relaxed code golf evaluator for python code. Currently both whitespace and
whole comment lines are stripped from the count so you can be happy to keep
some degree of legibility.

Either put the pygolf.py file in your path or run from this location with
something like:

```sh
path/to/pygolf.py potentially/different/path/to/examplefile
```

e.g.

```sh
./pygolf.py pygolf.py
```

currently outputs

```
97
```
